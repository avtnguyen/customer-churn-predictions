#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Motivations:
Customer churn can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. Losing customers means losing the revenue they generate, and acquiring new customers can be a costly and time-consuming process. By predicting which customers are at risk of churning, a company can take proactive steps to retain them and minimize the financial impact of churn.

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn. This model can be used by the company to identify at-risk customers and take targeted retention efforts, ultimately resulting in improved customer retention and profitability.

Additionally, understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn can help a company identify areas for improvement in its products, services, or customer experience. By analyzing the characteristics of churned customers and comparing them to those who have not churned, the company can identify potential areas for intervention and make changes to reduce churn in the future.

Overall, this customer churn prediction project has the potential to provide valuable insights and drive business impact for the company.


This data science project aims to predict customer churn for a fictional company using machine learning techniques. 
Churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the loss of customers over a certain period of time. 
Predicting churn can help a company identify at-risk customers and take steps to retain them.
